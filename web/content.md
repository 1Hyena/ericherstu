## Biography ###################################################################

| ![Photo of Erich Erstu](./gfx/biography.jpg "Photo of Erich Erstu")          |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Erich Erstu**, born on the 15th of February 1989                           |
|                                                                              |
| Native resident of Estonia                                                   |

In his professional life Erich Erstu is a software engineer and a computer game
developer who often challenges the mundane world of dogmas with his novel
approaches and unconventional thinking. Although he has spent a fair share of
his working hours devising [BitCoin][ref-2] and online gambling related projects
his favourite software engineering challenge is the creation of a horizontally
scalable game server for a massively multiplayer online role playing game.

He wrote his first computer program at the age of five in QBasic. At the age of
12 he developed his first video game using the _GameMaker_ software. He learned
the C programming language on his own while modding a multi user dungeon (MUD)
server. At the age of 16 he started learning C++ which also became his favourite
programming language. Although he used the Windows operating system up until the
year 2012, he switched to Linux due to security concerns when buying his first
BitCoin.

Over the course of his life Erich has created dozens of video games and a
multitude of software projects, albeit none of these endeavours has brought him
any long-lasting fame or fortune. His ability to see the future and to make good
speculative investments on the other hand has abundantly compensated him the
time he has spent on developing software. That said, he does not see any of his
discontinued projects as a failure. After all, if there were not for all those
projects, he would not be able to claim today that he is a seasoned software
developer.

In his private life Erich enjoys lifting weights in the gym as a hobbyist
bodybuilder and often times innovation strikes him exactly there when he is
taking a resting break between sets. When at home he spends much of his computer
time on research of various (mostly controversial) topics. He is convinced that
in order to gain a competitive advantage in front of his fellow man he must
discard the mainstream beliefs and hold a mindset that the majority of "well
educated" people are wrong about virtually everything.

Being experienced in so many different arts and sciences Erich considers himself
more of a multidisciplinary problem solver than a mere software engineer. While
programming has indeed been his primary task he has also been in the role of a
game designer, software architect, software tester, computer hacker, conscript,
truck driver, warehouse manager, investor, day trader, BitCoin miner, artist,
creative director, composer, lyricist, drummer, shaman, nutritional advisor,
fitness coach, holistic doctor, parasitologist, alchemist, evangelist, exorcist,
carpenter and a plaintiff, to name a few.

As this website concentrates on the software engineering aspect of Erich Erstu's
doings, in the following sections some of his video games and other software
projects are listed and briefly described.


## Games #######################################################################

Over the course of his life Erich Erstu has authored many computer games. While
the full list is not fit for public scrutiny some of the more notable titles are
listed below.


### Slice&Dice Dungeon #########################################################

Slice&Dice Dungeon (SnDD) is a multi user slot machine, backwards compatible to
Telnet. It is inspired by [MUDs][ref-0] and it incorporates aspects from typical
role-playing games. In addition to the Text User Interface, S&DD comes with a
browser based client written in HTML5 and Javascript. The latter is responsible
for making this game much more convenient for the vast majority of the target
audience as SnDC aims to resemble a slot machine.

software he has created.


# Research #####################################################################

From time to time Erich has ran into non-trivial problems that he needed to have
a solution for. In these circumstances the process of working out a solution has
required enough effort to be qualified as research. In this section some of the
more noteworthy research results are presented.

## Wave Function Collapse ######################################################

[Wave Function Collapse][ref-6] is a method devised for procedural generation of
images based on a sample image. The produced images are locally similar to the
input image, making this method highly convenient for pattern generation.

Unlike the original method, Erich Erstu's method operates on an unbounded area.
Also, his method tolerates contradictions. This variant of the Wave Function
Collapse method was initially implemented to generate random dungeon maps for an
online role-playing game.
